# Get distinct or unique column values in LibreOffice Calc

I usually want to produce a list that contains the unique or distinct column values in LibreOffice Calc (e.g. to obtain the set of assigned categories to my monthly transactions). It can be done with the LibreOffice Calc advanced filter (`Data/Filter/Standard Filter`);
1. Select the whole column including empty cells by clicking on the column header or select the subset of cells that you are interested in.
2. Go to meny `Data/Filter/Standard Filter`.
3. In the dialog that opens: 
    1. Select `None` in the `Field name` combobox.
    2. Display the options menu by clicking the `More options` button.
    3. Check the `No duplication` box.
    4. If applicable, check the box that indicates that your selection contains a column label.
4. Click Ok and the distinct cells will be displayed.
