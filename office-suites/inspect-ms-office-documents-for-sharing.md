# Inspect MS Office documents for sharing

I wanted to share a MS PowerPoint presentation but I didn't want to share my personal notes. Manually removing notes from each slide would be a tedious task, so I looked for a one-step way of doing it.

I finally discovered that MS Office has an option to inspect documents for hidden data and personal information. This option, described [here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Inspect-documents-for-hidden-data-and-personal-information-85951777-89dd-45dd-960a-fc979414e8fc), allows removing all kind of personal information contained in a MS document.
